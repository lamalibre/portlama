## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- Add service discovery & marketplace UI in the desktop app — auto-detects 17 well-known local services (Ollama, ComfyUI, LM Studio, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker containers, etc.) with one-click tunnel creation
- Add custom service definitions — users can register their own services with name, port, binary, process name, and category, persisted in `~/.portlama/services.json`
- Add Services tab in the desktop sidebar with category filtering (AI, Database, Docker, Dev, Media, Monitoring, Custom)
- Add shared `api.rs` module in the desktop app — extracted curl helpers from `commands.rs` for reuse across the Rust backend
- Add `@lamalibre/install-portlama-desktop` npx installer — downloads, caches, and installs the desktop app from GitHub Releases for macOS (arm64/x64) and Linux (x64)
- Add GitHub Actions workflow for desktop releases — manual trigger via `workflow_dispatch`, builds for macOS arm64, macOS x64, and Linux x64
- Add file type allowlist for static site uploads — only safe web assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images, fonts, media, documents, data, WASM) are accepted; server rejects disallowed extensions with 400
- Add ClamAV malware scanning via Docker in `portlama-agent deploy` — scans files before upload, aborts on infections, warns if Docker is unavailable
- Add extension allowlist check in `portlama-agent deploy` — aborts with listing if blocked files are found
- Add `sites:read` and `sites:write` agent capabilities for static site file management
- Add per-site scoping via `allowedSites` on agent certificates — agents can only see and modify files on sites explicitly assigned to them
- Add `PATCH /api/certs/agent/:label/allowed-sites` endpoint for managing agent site access
- Add site access UI in panel certificate management — assign sites to agents via checkboxes
- Add `portlama-agent sites` command to list, create, and delete static sites from the CLI
- Add `portlama-agent deploy <site> <path>` command to deploy a local directory to a static site
- Add Zod validation on file listing and upload query parameters for defense in depth
- Add remote shell access via tmux — admin can open a terminal on any agent machine through the existing WebSocket tunnel with `portlama-agent shell <label>`
- Add policy-based shell access control — named policies with IP allow/deny lists, command blocklists, inactivity timeouts, and file size limits
- Add 5-gate auth chain for shell sessions: global toggle → agent cert enabled → time window → IP check → admin cert
- Add shell session recording via `tmux pipe-pane`, stored on agent at `~/.portlama/shell-recordings/`
- Add session audit log on the panel server (`shell-sessions.json`)
- Add restricted shell wrapper (`portlama-shell.sh`) with hard-blocked patterns and configurable restricted commands
- Add file transfer between admin and agent: `portlama-agent cp <label>:/path ./local`
- Add session log viewer: `portlama-agent shell-log <label>`
- Add agent shell gateway: `portlama-agent shell-server` (background service, polls panel for shell access)
- Add Shell tab to the desktop app for managing policies, agent access, and sessions
- Add `GET /api/shell/agent-status` endpoint for agents to check their own shell access

### Changed

- Update site file endpoints (`GET/POST/DELETE /api/sites/:id/files`) to accept agent certificates with appropriate capabilities
- Update `GET /api/sites` to filter results based on agent's `allowedSites` when accessed with an agent certificate
- Update sudoers template to use `portlama:portlama` instead of installer's UID for file ownership

### Security

- Add curl config file atomic creation with `O_EXCL` and `0o600` permissions in the desktop app, preventing symlink attacks and race conditions
- Add input validation for custom service definitions — binary names, process names, categories validated against strict allowlists with length and count limits
- Add registry file validation on load to reject tampered entries in the desktop app
- Add subprocess timeouts (5-10s) on `pgrep`, `lsof`, and `docker ps` commands in the desktop app to prevent hangs
- Add Mutex-based serialization for registry mutations in the desktop app to prevent concurrent write races
- Add server-side file extension allowlist enforcement — blocks uploads of executable, scripting, and unknown file types regardless of client
- Add client-side (agent) file extension allowlist — catches disallowed files early with helpful error messages before upload
- Add ClamAV malware scanning in deploy pipeline — prevents deploying infected content to static sites
- Add symlink protection in deploy command directory scanner (skips symlinks, uses `lstat` to prevent TOCTOU)
- Add `encodeURIComponent` on all dynamic URL path segments in panel client API helpers and agent CLI
- Add regex validation on `allowedSites` entries in `UpdateAllowedSitesSchema`
- Add tmux special-key allowlist in shell gateway — only permitted key names (Enter, Escape, arrows, etc.) accepted
- Add strict CIDR prefix validation (1-32) for shell policy IP lists
- Add IPv6 normalization for IP access control — strips `::ffff:` prefix from IPv4-mapped addresses
- Add Mutex-based locking on shell session audit log to prevent concurrent write races
- Add PEM private key file permissions (0o600) in agent WebSocket helpers
- Add URL encoding on all dynamic path segments in desktop app Rust API calls
