## Quick Start

```bash
apt install -y npm
npx @lamalibre/create-portlama
```

Run this on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 droplet as root. The installer provisions everything with zero prompts, prints a client certificate and URL, and you disconnect SSH forever. All configuration happens through the browser-based management panel.

## What It Does

Portlama is a self-hosted secure tunneling platform that exposes web apps running behind a firewall (e.g., on a Mac Studio) through a VPS via WebSocket-over-HTTPS tunnels. A single command sets up the entire stack on a cheap VPS, and a browser-based panel handles everything after that.

The installer provisions the server, generates mTLS certificates for secure panel access, and starts all services. You import the client certificate into your browser, navigate to `https://<ip>:9292`, and complete the onboarding wizard to configure your domain, DNS, and tunnel services.

## Requirements

- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **Access**: Root (the installer must run as root)
- **RAM**: 512 MB minimum (the stack is optimized for low-memory VPS instances)
- **Domain**: Optional. IP-only mode works out of the box; a domain enables Let's Encrypt TLS and nicer URLs

## Architecture

```
npx @lamalibre/create-portlama (on fresh Ubuntu 24.04 droplet)
  Installs: Node.js, nginx, panel-server, panel-client, mTLS PKI
  Prints:   client.p12 + password + https://<ip>:9292
  SSH is never needed again.

Browser (with imported client certificate):
  https://<ip>:9292
    Onboarding wizard    -> domain, DNS verification, stack provisioning
    Management panel     -> dashboard, tunnels, users, certificates, services
```

**Components:**

| Component        | Technology        | Role                                       |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Reverse proxy    | nginx             | TLS termination, mTLS, forward auth        |
| Tunnel server    | Chisel            | WebSocket-over-HTTPS tunnels, bypasses DPI |
| Authentication   | Authelia          | TOTP 2FA for tunneled services             |
| Panel backend    | Fastify (Node.js) | REST API for management operations         |
| Panel frontend   | React + Vite      | Browser-based management UI                |
| TLS certificates | Let's Encrypt     | Free, auto-renewing domain certificates    |
| Panel auth       | mTLS certificates | LXD-style zero-login for admin access      |
| Desktop agent    | Tauri v2 (Rust)   | Native GUI with service discovery          |

## Features

- **Zero-prompt installer** -- one command provisions the entire stack
- **Browser-based onboarding** -- domain setup, DNS verification, and service provisioning through a wizard
- **Tunnel management** -- create, list, and remove tunnels with automatic nginx vhost and TLS certificate generation
- **User management** -- Authelia user CRUD with TOTP enrollment and QR code generation
- **Certificate management** -- Let's Encrypt certificate listing, renewal, and mTLS client certificate rotation
- **Service control** -- start, stop, and restart services with live log streaming via WebSocket
- **System dashboard** -- CPU, RAM, disk, and uptime monitoring with service health indicators
- **Desktop app** -- native macOS/Linux GUI with automatic service discovery (Ollama, ComfyUI, PostgreSQL, Docker containers, etc.) and one-click tunnel creation. Install with `npx @lamalibre/install-portlama-desktop`
- **Mac launchd plist** -- download a ready-to-use plist for running the Chisel client on macOS
- **IP fallback** -- `https://<ip>:9292` always works, even if the domain is lost
- **Low resource usage** -- the full stack runs within 250 MB RAM, suitable for $4/month VPS instances

## Security Model

- **mTLS for panel access** -- the management panel requires a client certificate. No certificate means the TLS handshake is rejected before any HTTP traffic is processed.
- **Authelia 2FA for tunneled services** -- all services exposed through tunnels are protected by Authelia with TOTP two-factor authentication.
- **Service binding** -- all services bind to `127.0.0.1` only. nginx is the sole public-facing service.
- **UFW firewall** -- only ports 22 (SSH, disabled after setup), 80 (HTTP redirect), 443 (HTTPS), and 9292 (panel) are open.
- **fail2ban** -- brute-force protection for SSH and nginx.
- **Atomic file writes** -- YAML configuration files (e.g., Authelia users) are written atomically to prevent corruption.
- **bcrypt password hashing** -- Authelia uses bcrypt instead of argon2id to avoid OOM kills on low-memory VPS instances.

## Configuration

All configuration lives under `/etc/portlama/`:

| File             | Purpose                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `panel.json`     | Panel server configuration (IP, domain, state) |
| `pki/ca.crt`     | mTLS certificate authority                     |
| `pki/ca.key`     | CA private key                                 |
| `pki/client.p12` | Client certificate bundle for browser import   |
| `tunnels.json`   | Tunnel definitions                             |

**Environment variables:**

| Variable      | Default                    | Description                       |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `CONFIG_FILE` | `/etc/portlama/panel.json` | Path to panel configuration       |
| `NODE_ENV`    | `production`               | Set to `development` to skip mTLS |

## Troubleshooting

**Cannot connect to the panel after importing the certificate:**

- Verify the certificate was imported correctly in your browser's certificate manager.
- Check that you are accessing `https://<ip>:9292` (not HTTP, not a different port).
- On macOS, you may need to restart the browser after importing the `.p12` file.

**Onboarding DNS verification fails:**

- DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours. Use `dig A yourdomain.com` to check if the record points to your VPS IP.
- Ensure you created an A record (not CNAME) pointing to the VPS IP address.

**Service fails to start:**

- Check the service logs: in the management panel, go to Services and click the log icon.
- Verify sufficient memory: `free -h` on the server. The stack needs at least 250 MB free.

**Let's Encrypt certificate issuance fails:**

- Port 80 must be open and reachable from the internet (certbot uses HTTP-01 challenge).
- Verify DNS is pointing to the correct IP: `dig A yourdomain.com`.
- Check certbot logs: `/var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log`.

**Tunnel client cannot connect from Mac:**

- **Recommended:** Install the desktop app with `npx @lamalibre/install-portlama-desktop` — it manages tunnels through a GUI.
- **Alternative:** Download the launchd plist from the Tunnels page in the management panel. Load it with `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.portlama.chisel.plist`. Check client logs: `cat /tmp/chisel-portlama.log`.

This software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The authors and contributors accept no liability for any damages, data loss, security incidents, or legal consequences arising from the use of this software.

Portlama is designed for self-hosted use cases — personal projects, development environments, demos, and internal tools. It is not a substitute for production infrastructure. Production workloads require dedicated hosting, load balancing, redundancy, monitoring, and operational expertise that are beyond the scope of this project.

**You are solely responsible for what you expose through Portlama.** By tunneling an application to the public internet, you grant anyone with access the ability to interact with that application as if they were on your local network. This carries inherent risks:

- **Arbitrary code execution:** If the tunneled application contains vulnerabilities or backdoors, remote attackers may exploit them to execute code on your machine, access your file system, or compromise your operating system.
- **Data exposure:** Misconfigured or insecure applications may leak sensitive data, credentials, or private files to the internet.
- **Lateral movement:** A compromised tunneled application may be used as an entry point to attack other devices and services on your local network.
- **Resource abuse:** Publicly accessible applications may be used for cryptocurrency mining, spam relaying, botnet hosting, or other abuse that could result in legal action against you.

Portlama provides authentication and access control mechanisms, but no security measure is absolute. It is your responsibility to understand the software you expose, keep it updated, and assess the risks of making it publicly accessible. The authors of Portlama bear no responsibility for the consequences of tunneling untrusted, vulnerable, or malicious software.
