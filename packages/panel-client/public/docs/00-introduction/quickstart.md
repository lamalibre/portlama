# Quick Start

> Go from zero to your first publicly accessible tunnel in about 10 minutes, using a $4 DigitalOcean droplet and your Mac or Linux machine.

## In Plain English

This guide walks you through the entire process of setting up Portlama. By the end, you will have a web app running on your machine that anyone on the internet can access through your own domain, protected by two-factor authentication.

Think of it as three steps: rent a storefront (create a droplet), set up the store (run the installer), and open for business (create a tunnel). The whole process takes about as long as making a cup of coffee.

## For Users

> **Alternative:** If you prefer a graphical experience, the [Desktop App](../02-guides/desktop-app-setup.md) can provision a DigitalOcean droplet and set up everything automatically — no SSH required. See the [Cloud Provisioning guide](../02-guides/cloud-provisioning.md) for a step-by-step walkthrough. The guide below covers the manual SSH approach.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

| Requirement                | Details                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DigitalOcean account**   | Any cloud provider works, but this guide uses DigitalOcean. You need a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 droplet. |
| **Domain name**            | A domain you control (e.g., `example.com`). You need access to its DNS settings.                   |
| **Mac (or Linux machine)** | The computer running the web apps you want to expose. Must have outbound internet access.          |
| **SSH key**                | An SSH key pair for accessing the droplet. DigitalOcean can generate one during droplet creation.  |
| **A local web app**        | Something listening on a port — a dev server, a blog engine, any HTTP service.                     |

**Cost:** $4/month for the smallest DigitalOcean droplet (512MB RAM, 1 vCPU). That is all you need.

---

### Step 1: Create a Droplet

Log in to DigitalOcean and create a new droplet:

| Setting        | Value                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Image          | Ubuntu 24.04 (LTS)                         |
| Plan           | Basic, $4/mo (512MB RAM, 1 vCPU, 10GB SSD) |
| Region         | Closest to your users                      |
| Authentication | SSH key (not password)                     |

Wait for the droplet to boot. Note its public IP address (e.g., `203.0.113.42`).

```
Droplet created: 203.0.113.42
```

---

### Step 2: Run the Installer

SSH into the droplet and run the Portlama installer:

```bash
ssh root@203.0.113.42
```

Once connected:

```bash
apt install -y npm
npx @lamalibre/create-portlama
```

The installer displays a confirmation banner showing what it will do:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│    * Deploy panel to /opt/portlama/                         │
│                                                             │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Press Enter to continue. The installer runs for 2-3 minutes:

╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

---

### Step 3: Download the Client Certificate

On your local machine (not the droplet), open a new terminal and run the SCP command from the summary:

```bash
scp root@203.0.113.42:/etc/portlama/pki/client.p12 .
```

This downloads `client.p12` to your current directory. This file is your admin credential — it proves to the panel that you are the owner.

---

### Step 4: Import the Certificate

The import process varies by operating system:

**macOS:**

1. Double-click `client.p12`
2. Keychain Access opens. Select the **System** keychain (not "login")
3. Enter the certificate password from the installer summary
4. Find the certificate in the System keychain, double-click it
5. Expand **Trust**, set to **Always Trust**
6. Close and enter your macOS password to confirm

If you see an error about "Local Items" — ignore it. The System keychain import is what matters.

**Linux (Chrome/Chromium):**

1. Open Chrome Settings, then Privacy and Security, then Security
2. Click Manage certificates, then Import
3. Select `client.p12` and enter the password

**Windows:**

1. Double-click `client.p12`
2. The Certificate Import Wizard opens
3. Enter the password and follow the prompts

After importing, **restart your browser** to ensure it picks up the new certificate.

---

### Step 5: Open the Admin Panel

Navigate to the URL from the installer summary:

```
https://203.0.113.42:9292
```

Your browser will show two prompts:

1. **Self-signed certificate warning**: Click "Advanced" then "Proceed" (this is expected — the panel uses a self-signed TLS certificate for the IP-based URL)
2. **Client certificate selection**: Your browser asks which certificate to use. Select the Portlama certificate you just imported.

You are now in the admin panel. The onboarding wizard starts automatically.

---

### Step 6: Complete Onboarding

The onboarding wizard has three steps:

**Step 6a: Domain and Email**

Enter your domain name and email address:

```
Domain:  example.com
Email:   admin@example.com
```

The email is used for Let's Encrypt certificate notifications. The domain is where your tunneled apps will be accessible.

**Step 6b: DNS Verification**

The wizard shows the DNS records you need to create:

```
Type    Name              Value
A       example.com       203.0.113.42
A       *.example.com     203.0.113.42
```

Go to your domain registrar's DNS settings and create these records. The wildcard (`*`) record allows you to create tunnels like `app.example.com`, `blog.example.com`, etc., without adding DNS records for each one.

Click "Verify DNS" in the wizard. It checks that the records resolve correctly. DNS propagation can take a few minutes — the wizard retries automatically.

**Step 6c: Provisioning**

Click "Provision" and watch the progress. The wizard:

1. Downloads and installs Chisel (tunnel server)
2. Downloads and installs Authelia (2FA authentication)
3. Creates the first admin user with TOTP 2FA
4. Issues a Let's Encrypt TLS certificate for your domain
5. Writes nginx vhost configurations
6. Starts all services

This takes 1-2 minutes. When it finishes, onboarding is complete. The page shows your first user's TOTP QR code — scan it with Google Authenticator, Authy, or any TOTP app.

---

### Step 7: Create Your First Tunnel

You are now in the management panel. Navigate to **Tunnels** and click **Create Tunnel**.

Fill in the tunnel details:

| Field       | Example      | Description                          |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Subdomain   | `myapp`      | Creates `myapp.example.com`          |
| Local port  | `8001`       | The port your app listens on locally |
| Description | `My web app` | Optional label                       |

Click **Create**. The panel:

1. Writes an nginx vhost for `myapp.example.com`
2. Configures Chisel to route traffic to `localhost:8001`
3. Reloads nginx

---

### Step 8: Connect the Mac Client

**Option A — Desktop App (recommended):**

Install the Portlama Desktop app, which provides a GUI with automatic service discovery and one-click tunnel creation:

```bash
npx @lamalibre/install-portlama-desktop
```

The app auto-detects local services (Ollama, ComfyUI, PostgreSQL, Docker containers, etc.) and lets you expose them with one click. See the [Desktop App Setup](../02-guides/desktop-app-setup.md) guide for details.

**Option B — Launchd plist:**

After creating the tunnel, the panel shows a **Download plist** button. This downloads a macOS launchd configuration file that keeps the Chisel client running and auto-reconnecting. See the [Mac Client Setup](../02-guides/mac-client-setup.md) guide for details.

**Option C — Manual Chisel:**

Run the Chisel client directly:

```bash
chisel client \
  --tls-skip-verify \
  https://tunnel.example.com:443 \
  R:127.0.0.1:8001:127.0.0.1:8001
```

The `R:127.0.0.1:8001:127.0.0.1:8001` part means: "Reverse-forward port 8001 on the server's localhost to port 8001 on my Mac."

---

### Step 9: Test It

Open a browser and go to:

```
https://myapp.example.com
```

You will see the Authelia login page. Log in with the credentials created during onboarding (username + TOTP code from your authenticator app).

After authenticating, you see your local web app, served through the tunnel.

---

### Step 10: Disconnect SSH

Go back to your SSH terminal and type:

```bash
exit
```

You are done with SSH. Everything from here on is managed through the browser panel at `https://203.0.113.42:9292`.

If you ever need SSH again (disaster recovery, manual debugging), it is still available on port 22 with key-based authentication. But for normal operations, you will never need it.

---

```

## For Developers

### Installer CLI Flags

The installer accepts optional flags:

```bash
npx @lamalibre/create-portlama [flags]
```

| Flag            | Effect                                          |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `--help`, `-h`  | Print help message and exit                     |
| `--yes`, `-y`   | Skip the confirmation prompt                    |
| `--skip-harden` | Skip OS hardening (swap, UFW, fail2ban, SSH)    |
| `--dev`         | Allow private/non-routable IP addresses         |
| `--force-full`  | Run full installation even on existing installs |
| `--uninstall`   | Print manual removal guide and exit             |

The `--dev` flag is useful for testing on local VMs that do not have public IP addresses.

The `--skip-harden` flag is useful when re-running the installer on a machine that was already hardened, or when you want to manage hardening separately.

### Re-running the Installer

The installer is idempotent. Running it again on an existing installation:

- Preserves `panel.json` configuration (merges, does not overwrite)
- Skips mTLS certificate generation if certificates already exist
- Skips swap creation if swap is already active
- Skips UFW configuration if all required ports are already allowed
- Skips fail2ban if already configured and running
- Updates panel-server and panel-client files
- Restarts the panel service

This means you can safely re-run the installer after an update to the `create-portlama` package without losing your configuration or certificates.

### Development Mode

For local development without a VPS:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start panel backend
cd packages/panel-server
CONFIG_FILE=../../dev/panel.json NODE_ENV=development node src/index.js

# Terminal 2: Start panel frontend (Vite dev server, proxies /api to :3100)
cd packages/panel-client
npx vite
```

In development mode (`NODE_ENV=development` or `NODE_ENV` unset), the panel server skips mTLS client certificate verification, so you can access it without importing a certificate.

### Troubleshooting

**Browser does not prompt for certificate:**

- Make sure you imported the `.p12` into the correct keychain (System on macOS)
- Restart the browser completely (not just the tab)
- Check that the certificate is trusted (macOS: Keychain Access, find cert, Trust, Always Trust)

**Installer fails at "Detecting IP address":**

- The droplet must have a public IP address
- Use `--dev` flag for testing on private networks

**DNS verification fails:**

- DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours (usually minutes)
- Verify records with `dig example.com` or `nslookup example.com`
- Make sure you created both the `A` record and the wildcard `*.example.com` record

**Panel service fails to start:**

- Check logs: `journalctl -u portlama-panel -n 50`
- Verify config: `cat /etc/portlama/panel.json`
- Check if port 3100 is in use: `ss -tlnp sport = :3100`
