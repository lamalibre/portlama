# nginx Reverse Proxy

> nginx is the only public-facing service in Portlama — it terminates TLS, enforces mTLS for the admin panel, delegates authentication to Authelia for tunneled apps, and proxies all traffic to internal services.

## In Plain English

Every request that reaches your Portlama server goes through nginx first. Think of nginx as a concierge at a hotel. Every guest must pass through the lobby. The concierge checks credentials, directs guests to the right room, and turns away anyone who does not belong.

When a visitor arrives, nginx handles several jobs:

1. **Encryption** — it decrypts the HTTPS connection (TLS termination), so internal services do not need to deal with TLS themselves
2. **Routing** — it looks at the domain name in the request (e.g., `panel.example.com` vs `myapp.example.com`) and sends the request to the right internal service
3. **Authentication** — for the admin panel, it checks for a client certificate; for tunneled apps, it asks Authelia if the visitor is logged in
4. **Protection** — it is the only service listening on public ports, so everything else is shielded from direct internet access

No other service in Portlama listens on a public network interface. nginx is the single point of entry.

## For Users

### What nginx does for you

You do not interact with nginx directly. The management panel handles all nginx configuration changes behind the scenes:

- When you complete onboarding, nginx vhosts are created for `panel.example.com`, `auth.example.com`, and `tunnel.example.com`
- When you create a tunnel, an nginx vhost is created for `myapp.example.com`
- When TLS certificates are renewed, nginx reloads to pick up the new certificates
- When you delete a tunnel, the vhost is removed and nginx reloads

### The IP fallback

The panel is always accessible at `https://<your-ip>:9292`, even if your domain's DNS is misconfigured or your Let's Encrypt certificates expire. This IP-based vhost uses a self-signed certificate (your browser shows a warning) and requires the [mTLS client certificate](mtls.md).

This is your emergency backdoor. If everything goes wrong with domains and certificates, you can always reach the admin panel through the IP address.

### Vhosts in Portlama

Each service gets its own virtual host (vhost) — a configuration block that tells nginx how to handle requests for a specific domain:

| Domain               | Internal service            | Authentication                     | Port |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---- |
| `https://<ip>:9292`  | Panel server (`:3100`)      | mTLS client certificate            | 9292 |
| `panel.example.com`  | Panel server (`:3100`)      | mTLS client certificate            | 443  |
| `auth.example.com`   | Authelia (`:9091`)          | None (it is the auth service)      | 443  |
| `tunnel.example.com` | Chisel server (`:9090`)     | None (Chisel handles its own auth) | 443  |
| `myapp.example.com`  | Chisel → your machine (`:3000`) | Authelia TOTP 2FA                  | 443  |

### When things go wrong

If nginx fails to start or reload, your services become unreachable because nginx is the only public-facing gateway. The panel server always validates the nginx configuration (`nginx -t`) before reloading. If validation fails, the change is rolled back and the current configuration stays in place.

## For Developers

### Vhost architecture

nginx vhost files live in the standard Debian layout:

```
/etc/nginx/
├── nginx.conf                          # Main config (default)
├── snippets/
│   └── portlama-mtls.conf             # mTLS snippet (included by panel vhosts)
├── sites-available/
│   ├── portlama-panel-ip              # IP:9292 vhost (always present)
│   ├── portlama-panel-domain          # panel.example.com (after onboarding)
│   ├── portlama-auth                  # auth.example.com (after onboarding)
│   ├── portlama-tunnel                # tunnel.example.com (after onboarding)
│   ├── portlama-app-myapp             # myapp.example.com (per tunnel)
│   └── portlama-site-<uuid>           # Static site vhosts
└── sites-enabled/
    └── (symlinks to sites-available)
```

All Portlama vhost files are prefixed with `portlama-` to distinguish them from any pre-existing nginx configurations.

### The IP-based panel vhost

This vhost is created during installation and is the only vhost that exists before onboarding:

```nginx
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default upgrade;
    ''      close;
}

server {
    listen 9292 ssl;
    server_name _;

    ssl_certificate /etc/portlama/pki/self-signed.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/portlama/pki/self-signed-key.pem;

    # mTLS enforcement
    include /etc/nginx/snippets/portlama-mtls.conf;

    # SSL settings
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    # Help page for visitors without client cert
    error_page 495 496 /cert-help.html;
    location = /cert-help.html {
        root /opt/portlama/panel-client;
        internal;
    }

    # Proxy to panel-server
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3100;

        # Client cert headers — set from nginx TLS variables, never passed through from client
        proxy_set_header X-SSL-Client-Verify $ssl_client_verify;
        proxy_set_header X-SSL-Client-DN $ssl_client_s_dn;
        proxy_set_header X-SSL-Client-Serial $ssl_client_serial;

        # Standard proxy headers
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    # API paths with WebSocket upgrade support
    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3100;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;

        # Client cert headers — set from nginx TLS variables, never passed through from client
        proxy_set_header X-SSL-Client-Verify $ssl_client_verify;
        proxy_set_header X-SSL-Client-DN $ssl_client_s_dn;
        proxy_set_header X-SSL-Client-Serial $ssl_client_serial;

        # Standard proxy headers
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # WebSocket: only upgrade when client requests it
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Key details:

- **Port 9292** — non-standard port to avoid conflicting with domain-based vhosts on 443
- **`server_name _`** — matches any hostname (catch-all for IP access)
- **Self-signed cert** — browsers show a security warning, which is expected for IP access
- **mTLS snippet** — requires client certificate at the TLS level
- **Error pages 495/496** — nginx-specific error codes for missing (496) or failed (495) client certificates

### The mTLS snippet

The snippet at `/etc/nginx/snippets/portlama-mtls.conf` contains two directives:

```nginx
ssl_client_certificate /etc/portlama/pki/ca.crt;
ssl_verify_client on;
```

- **`ssl_client_certificate`** — points to the CA certificate that signed the admin's client certificate
- **`ssl_verify_client on`** — hard requirement; connections without a valid client certificate are rejected at the TLS layer

This snippet is included in both the IP-based vhost and the domain-based panel vhost. It is not included in app vhosts (those use Authelia instead).

### Domain-based panel vhost

Created during onboarding for `panel.example.com`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name panel.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/panel.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/panel.example.com/privkey.pem;

    # mTLS — same as IP-based access
    include /etc/nginx/snippets/portlama-mtls.conf;

    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3100;

        # Client cert headers — set from nginx TLS variables, never passed through from client
        proxy_set_header X-SSL-Client-Verify $ssl_client_verify;
        proxy_set_header X-SSL-Client-DN $ssl_client_s_dn;
        proxy_set_header X-SSL-Client-Serial $ssl_client_serial;

        # Standard proxy headers
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    # API paths with WebSocket upgrade support
    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3100;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;

        # Client cert headers — set from nginx TLS variables, never passed through from client
        proxy_set_header X-SSL-Client-Verify $ssl_client_verify;
        proxy_set_header X-SSL-Client-DN $ssl_client_s_dn;
        proxy_set_header X-SSL-Client-Serial $ssl_client_serial;

        # Standard proxy headers
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # WebSocket: only upgrade when client requests it
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
    }
}
```

The difference from the IP vhost: port 443 instead of 9292, Let's Encrypt certificates instead of self-signed, and a specific `server_name` instead of catch-all. Requires the same `map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade` block to be present.

### App tunnel vhost with Authelia

Each tunneled app gets a vhost with the [Authelia forward-auth pattern](authentication.md):

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name myapp.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/myapp.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/myapp.example.com/privkey.pem;

    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

    # Authelia forward authentication (AuthRequest implementation for nginx)
    location /internal/authelia/authz {
        internal;

        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9091/api/authz/auth-request;
        proxy_pass_request_body off;

        proxy_set_header Content-Length "";
        proxy_set_header Connection "";
        proxy_set_header X-Original-Method $request_method;
        proxy_set_header X-Original-URL $scheme://$http_host$request_uri;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;

        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_buffers 4 32k;
        proxy_next_upstream error timeout invalid_header http_500 http_502 http_503;
    }

    location / {
        auth_request /internal/authelia/authz;
        auth_request_set $user $upstream_http_remote_user;
        auth_request_set $groups $upstream_http_remote_groups;
        auth_request_set $name $upstream_http_remote_name;
        auth_request_set $email $upstream_http_remote_email;
        auth_request_set $redirection_url $upstream_http_location;

        proxy_set_header Remote-User $user;
        proxy_set_header Remote-Groups $groups;
        proxy_set_header Remote-Name $name;
        proxy_set_header Remote-Email $email;

        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:PORT;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;

        # WebSocket support
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

        proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
        proxy_send_timeout 86400s;
    }

    # Redirect unauthenticated requests to Authelia login portal
    error_page 401 =302 $redirection_url;
}
```

The `location /internal/authelia/authz` block is marked `internal`, meaning it cannot be accessed directly by clients. It is only triggered by the `auth_request` directive in the main `location /` block.

### Tunnel (Chisel) vhost

The WebSocket tunnel endpoint at `tunnel.example.com`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name tunnel.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/tunnel.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/tunnel.example.com/privkey.pem;

    # ... standard SSL and proxy headers ...

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9090;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

        # Long timeout for persistent WebSocket connections
        proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
        proxy_send_timeout 86400s;
    }
}
```

The 24-hour timeouts (`86400s`) are essential for the Chisel WebSocket connection, which stays open indefinitely. Without these timeouts, nginx would close idle connections after 60 seconds (the default).

### WebSocket upgrade headers

WebSocket connections start as HTTP and then "upgrade" to the WebSocket protocol. nginx needs explicit configuration to pass this upgrade through:

```nginx
proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
```

The `$connection_upgrade` variable comes from a `map` block defined at the top of the IP panel vhost:

```nginx
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default upgrade;
    ''      close;
}
```

- **`proxy_http_version 1.1`** — WebSocket requires HTTP/1.1 (not 1.0)
- **`Upgrade`** — forwards the client's upgrade request to the backend
- **`Connection $connection_upgrade`** — set to `upgrade` when the client requests a WebSocket upgrade, or `close` for regular HTTP requests. This avoids keeping non-WebSocket connections open unnecessarily

These headers appear in three places: the panel vhost (for live log streaming), the tunnel vhost (for Chisel), and app vhosts (for apps that use WebSockets).

### Proxy headers

Every vhost sets standard proxy headers so backend services know about the original request:

| Header              | nginx variable               | Purpose                           |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `Host`              | `$host`                      | Original hostname from the client |
| `X-Real-IP`         | `$remote_addr`               | Client's actual IP address        |
| `X-Forwarded-For`   | `$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for` | Chain of proxy IPs                |
| `X-Forwarded-Proto` | `$scheme`                    | Original protocol (http or https) |

For mTLS vhosts, three additional headers are set:

| Header                | nginx variable       | Purpose                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `X-SSL-Client-Verify` | `$ssl_client_verify` | `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, or `NONE`   |
| `X-SSL-Client-DN`     | `$ssl_client_s_dn`   | Client certificate subject DN    |
| `X-SSL-Client-Serial` | `$ssl_client_serial` | Client certificate serial number |

### Safe write-with-rollback

All vhost writes follow a safe sequence to prevent nginx from entering a broken state:

```
1. Back up existing vhost (if any) → file.bak
2. Write new vhost to sites-available/
3. Create symlink in sites-enabled/
4. Run nginx -t (test configuration)
5a. If test passes → reload nginx, delete backup
5b. If test fails → restore backup, remove new file, throw error
```

This pattern is implemented in `packages/panel-server/src/lib/nginx.js`:

```javascript
export async function writeAppVhost(subdomain, domain, port, certPath) {
  // ... build config string ...

  const existed = await fileExistsSudo(availablePath);
  if (existed) {
    await execa('sudo', ['cp', availablePath, bakPath]); // Backup
  }

  try {
    await writeVhostFile(name, config); // Write new vhost
    await enableSite(name); // Symlink
    const result = await testConfig(); // nginx -t

    if (!result.valid) {
      // Rollback
      if (existed) {
        await execa('sudo', ['mv', bakPath, availablePath]);
      } else {
        await execa('sudo', ['rm', '-f', availablePath]);
        await execa('sudo', ['rm', '-f', enabledPath]);
      }
      throw new Error(`Nginx config test failed: ${result.error}`);
    }

    await reload(); // Reload nginx
  } catch (err) {
    // Rollback on any unexpected error
    // ...
  }
}
```

The `nginx -t` command parses the entire configuration and reports syntax errors without affecting the running server. Only after it passes does the code reload nginx.

### TLS configuration

All vhosts use the same TLS settings:

```nginx
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
```

- **TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3** — modern protocols only; TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 are disabled
- **`HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5`** — strong cipher suites only, no anonymous or MD5 ciphers
- **`ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on`** — server chooses the cipher, not the client

### Static site vhosts

Static sites served directly by nginx (without proxying to a backend) use a different template:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name blog.example.com;

    # ... TLS configuration ...

    root /var/www/portlama/<site-id>/;
    index index.html;

    # Security headers
    add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff always;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        # Or for SPAs: try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

Static sites can optionally include Authelia forward-auth protection if the `autheliaProtected` flag is set.
