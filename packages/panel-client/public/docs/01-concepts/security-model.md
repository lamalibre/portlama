# Security Model

> Portlama uses a defense-in-depth strategy with multiple independent security layers — OS hardening, firewall, TLS encryption, mTLS authentication, TOTP 2FA, and service isolation — so that no single vulnerability compromises the system.

## In Plain English

Security in Portlama works like layers of protection around a castle. Each layer is independent, so even if an attacker gets past one, they face another.

The outermost layer is the **firewall** — only four doors exist (ports 22, 80, 443, and 9292), and all others are sealed shut. The next layer is **encryption** — every conversation is in a secret language (TLS). Then comes **authentication** — the admin panel checks your digital ID card (client certificate), and the tunneled apps check your password and phone code (TOTP). The innermost layer is **isolation** — each service runs in its own room, and even if one is compromised, it cannot reach the others.

No single layer is perfect. Firewalls can be misconfigured. TLS has had vulnerabilities. Passwords get stolen. But the chance of all layers failing simultaneously is vanishingly small. This approach — multiple imperfect layers that together provide strong security — is called defense in depth.

## For Users

### What protects you

Here is every security measure Portlama puts in place, from the outside in:

#### 1. Firewall (UFW)

Only four ports are open on your VPS:

| Port     | Service | Who needs it                                                       |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 22/tcp   | SSH     | You, during installation only                                      |
| 80/tcp   | HTTP    | Let's Encrypt HTTP-01 challenge (certificate issuance and renewal) |
| 443/tcp  | HTTPS   | Everyone (domains)                                                 |
| 9292/tcp | HTTPS   | You (admin panel via IP)                                           |

Every other port is blocked. A port scan of your VPS shows only these four services.

#### 2. fail2ban

An automated intrusion prevention system that watches log files for suspicious activity:

- **SSH jail** — bans an IP for 1 hour after 5 failed login attempts
- **nginx jail** — bans an IP for 1 hour after 5 failed HTTP authentication attempts

Banning means adding a firewall rule that drops all packets from the offending IP.

#### 3. SSH hardening

After installation, SSH is locked down:

| Setting                           | Value               | Effect                          |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `PasswordAuthentication`          | `no`                | Only key-based auth accepted    |
| `PermitRootLogin`                 | `prohibit-password` | Root can log in with keys only  |
| `ChallengeResponseAuthentication` | `no`                | No keyboard-interactive prompts |

This means SSH brute-force attacks (trying passwords) are impossible. An attacker would need your private SSH key.

#### 4. TLS encryption

Every connection to your VPS is encrypted with TLS 1.2 or 1.3. Even if someone intercepts the traffic (e.g., on a public Wi-Fi network), they cannot read or modify it.

- Domain-based vhosts use Let's Encrypt certificates (trusted by all browsers)
- The IP-based admin panel uses a self-signed certificate (browser warning, but still encrypted)

#### 5. mTLS for admin and agent access

The admin panel requires a client certificate at the TLS layer. Without the certificate, nginx rejects the connection before any HTTP traffic is exchanged. See [mTLS](mtls.md) for full details.

Portlama supports two types of certificates with different access levels:

- **Admin certificate** — full access to all panel endpoints (for browser-based management)
- **Agent certificate** — capability-based access (for Mac tunnel agents)

Agent certificates are generated from the panel UI and should be used instead of the admin certificate when connecting Mac agents. Each agent is assigned granular capabilities that control what it can access:

| Capability       | Grants                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `tunnels:read`   | List tunnels, download plist (always-on)   |
| `tunnels:write`  | Create and delete tunnels                  |
| `services:read`  | View service status                        |
| `services:write` | Start/stop/restart services                |
| `system:read`    | View system stats (CPU, RAM, disk)         |
| `sites:read`     | List assigned sites and browse their files |
| `sites:write`    | Upload and delete files on assigned sites  |

Capabilities are stored server-side and can be updated without reissuing the certificate. Users, certificates, agent management, and logs always remain admin-only. Site creation and deletion are also admin-only operations.

In addition to capabilities, agent certificates support **per-site scoping** via `allowedSites`. Each agent has a list of site names it is permitted to access. When an agent calls `GET /api/sites`, it only sees sites in its `allowedSites` list. File operations (upload, list, delete) require both the relevant capability and the site name in the agent's `allowedSites`. The admin manages site assignments from **Panel** > **Certificates** > edit agent > **Site Access**, or via the `PATCH /api/certs/agent/:label/allowed-sites` endpoint.

This two-level model (capabilities + site scoping) means that even if a Mac is compromised, the attacker is limited to whichever capabilities and sites were assigned to that agent — and the admin can revoke or reduce them immediately.

mTLS is stronger than a login page because:

- There is no password to brute-force
- There is no session to hijack
- There is no login endpoint to discover or attack
- The rejection happens before any application code runs

#### 6. TOTP 2FA for app access

Visitors to your tunneled apps authenticate through Authelia with a password and a TOTP code from their phone. See [Authentication](authentication.md) for full details.

#### 7. Service isolation

Every internal service binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) only. Even if an attacker somehow reaches your VPS's internal network, they cannot connect to these services from outside:

| Service       | Bind address | Port |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---- |
| Panel server  | `127.0.0.1`  | 3100 |
| Authelia      | `127.0.0.1`  | 9091 |
| Chisel server | `127.0.0.1`  | 9090 |

nginx is the only service listening on public interfaces. It acts as a gateway, proxying authenticated requests to the internal services.

### The RAM constraint and bcrypt

Your VPS has only 512MB of RAM. This matters for security because some password hashing algorithms are memory-hungry. Argon2id (the "gold standard" for password hashing) allocates ~93MB per hash. On a 512MB system running multiple services, a single authentication attempt with argon2id can consume all available memory and crash everything.

Portlama uses bcrypt instead. Bcrypt uses ~4KB per hash — over 23,000 times less memory — while still providing strong protection against brute-force attacks. The cost factor is set to 12, meaning each hash computation takes roughly 250ms, making large-scale password cracking impractical.

### What is NOT included

Portlama does not include:

- **Rate limiting at the application level** — fail2ban handles this at the network level
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)** — your tunneled apps should implement their own input validation
- **DDoS protection** — consider Cloudflare or DigitalOcean's cloud firewall for DDoS mitigation
- **Automatic security updates** — enable Ubuntu's unattended-upgrades for OS patches

### UFW firewall implementation

The installer configures UFW in `packages/create-portlama/src/tasks/harden.js`:

```javascript
// Set defaults
await execa('ufw', ['default', 'deny', 'incoming']);
await execa('ufw', ['default', 'allow', 'outgoing']);

// Allow only required ports
const requiredPorts = ['22/tcp', '80/tcp', '443/tcp', '9292/tcp'];
for (const port of requiredPorts) {
  await execa('ufw', ['allow', port]);
}

// Enable firewall
await execa('ufw', ['--force', 'enable']);
```

The task is idempotent — if UFW is already active with all required ports allowed, it skips the setup entirely. If UFW is active but missing some ports, it adds only the missing rules without resetting existing configuration.

### fail2ban configuration

fail2ban is configured via a drop-in file at `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/portlama.conf`:

```ini
[sshd]
enabled = true
port = ssh
filter = sshd
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 5
bantime = 3600

[nginx-http-auth]
enabled = true
port = http,https
filter = nginx-http-auth
logpath = /var/log/nginx/error.log
maxretry = 5
bantime = 3600
```

Two jails are configured:

| Jail              | Monitors                   | Trigger             | Ban duration |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| `sshd`            | `/var/log/auth.log`        | 5 failed SSH logins | 1 hour       |
| `nginx-http-auth` | `/var/log/nginx/error.log` | 5 failed HTTP auths | 1 hour       |

Using a drop-in file in `jail.d/` rather than modifying `jail.local` preserves any existing fail2ban configuration and makes the Portlama rules easy to identify and remove.

### SSH hardening implementation

The installer modifies `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` with a safe sequence:

```
1. Read original sshd_config
2. Check if all settings are already correct → skip if so
3. Apply regex modifications to produce new content
4. Write modified content to a temp file
5. Validate with sshd -t -f /path/to/temp
6. If validation fails → delete temp, leave original untouched
7. If validation passes → back up original, move temp into place
8. Restart sshd
```

The settings applied:

```
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
```

The pre-installation backup is saved to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.pre-portlama` and is only created once (subsequent re-runs skip the backup step to preserve the original).

### Swap file

The installer creates a 1GB swap file as a safety net against memory pressure:

```javascript
await execa('fallocate', ['-l', '1G', '/swapfile']);
await execa('chmod', ['600', '/swapfile']);
await execa('mkswap', ['/swapfile']);
await execa('swapon', ['/swapfile']);
```

Swappiness is set to 10 (conservative — the kernel prefers using RAM and only swaps under heavy pressure):

```ini
# /etc/sysctl.d/99-portlama.conf
vm.swappiness=10
```

The swap file is added to `/etc/fstab` to persist across reboots.

### RAM budget

The 512MB VPS RAM is carefully allocated:

| Service      | Typical RAM | Notes                             |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| OS baseline  | ~120MB      | Kernel, systemd, base processes   |
| nginx        | ~15MB       | Low-memory reverse proxy          |
| Authelia     | ~25MB       | Go binary, minimal footprint      |
| Chisel       | ~20MB       | Go binary, WebSocket multiplexing |
| Panel server | ~30MB       | Node.js, Fastify                  |
| fail2ban     | ~35MB       | Python-based, log monitoring      |
| **Total**    | **~245MB**  |                                   |
| **Headroom** | **~265MB**  | Available for spikes              |
| **Swap**     | **1GB**     | Safety net                        |

This budget is why bcrypt (not argon2id) is mandatory for password hashing. Argon2id's ~93MB per hash would consume over a third of total RAM on a single authentication attempt.

### bcrypt configuration

Authelia is configured with bcrypt cost factor 12:

```yaml
authentication_backend:
  file:
    path: /etc/authelia/users.yml
    password:
      algorithm: bcrypt
      bcrypt:
        cost: 12
```

Cost factor 12 means 2^12 = 4096 iterations. Benchmarks on typical hardware:

| Cost factor | Time per hash | Suitable for                    |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 10          | ~65ms         | High-traffic sites              |
| 12          | ~250ms        | Portlama (good balance)         |
| 14          | ~1000ms       | Very high security requirements |

At cost 12, an attacker with a stolen hash trying 4 passwords per second would need ~8 years to try 100 million passwords. This is sufficient for a self-hosted system that also has fail2ban and network-level protections.

### Service isolation details

All internal services bind to `127.0.0.1`, which means they only accept connections from the same machine. Even if an attacker gains network access to the VPS (e.g., through a compromised container on the same network segment), they cannot reach these services.

The Chisel server explicitly sets `--host 127.0.0.1` in its systemd unit:

```ini
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/chisel server --reverse --port 9090 --host 127.0.0.1
```

Authelia is configured in its YAML:

```yaml
server:
  address: 'tcp://127.0.0.1:9091/'
```

The panel server binds to localhost in its Fastify configuration.

nginx is the only service with a public-facing socket. It listens on:

- `0.0.0.0:443` for domain-based vhosts
- `0.0.0.0:9292` for the IP-based admin panel

### File permissions

Sensitive files use restrictive permissions:

| File                              | Mode  | Rationale                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `/etc/portlama/pki/ca.key`        | `600` | CA private key — can sign new client certs |
| `/etc/portlama/pki/client.key`    | `600` | Client private key                         |
| `/etc/portlama/pki/client.p12`    | `600` | PKCS12 bundle with private key             |
| `/etc/portlama/pki/.p12-password` | `600` | Password for the .p12 file                 |
| `/etc/authelia/configuration.yml` | `600` | Contains JWT and session secrets           |
| `/etc/authelia/.secrets.json`     | `600` | Secret backup                              |
| `/etc/authelia/users.yml`         | `600` | Password hashes                            |
| `/etc/portlama/pki/`              | `700` | PKI directory itself                       |

Mode `600` means only the file owner (root) can read or write. Mode `700` means only the directory owner can list, read, or modify contents.

### Secret generation

All secrets are generated using `crypto.randomBytes`, which reads from the operating system's cryptographically secure random number generator (`/dev/urandom` on Linux):

```javascript
import { randomBytes } from 'crypto';
const password = randomBytes(24).toString('base64url');
```

No secrets are hardcoded in the codebase. Each installation generates unique secrets for:

- PKCS12 bundle password
- Authelia JWT secret
- Authelia session secret
- Authelia storage encryption key

### Onboarding state transitions

The onboarding system enforces a strict state machine that prevents accessing management features before the system is fully provisioned:

```
FRESH → DOMAIN_SET → DNS_READY → PROVISIONING → COMPLETED
```

| State          | Onboarding endpoints | Management endpoints |
| -------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| `FRESH`        | Available            | Return 503           |
| `DOMAIN_SET`   | Available            | Return 503           |
| `DNS_READY`    | Available            | Return 503           |
| `PROVISIONING` | Available            | Return 503           |
| `COMPLETED`    | Return 410 Gone      | Available            |

After onboarding completes, all onboarding endpoints return 410 Gone. This prevents re-running onboarding, which could overwrite configuration or issue duplicate certificates.

### Atomic file writes

Configuration files that are read live by services (like Authelia's `users.yml`) use atomic writes to prevent partial reads:

```javascript
async function sudoWriteFile(destPath, content, mode = '644') {
  const tmpFile = path.join(tmpdir(), `portlama-${crypto.randomBytes(4).toString('hex')}`);
  await fsWriteFile(tmpFile, content, 'utf-8');
  await execa('sudo', ['mv', tmpFile, destPath]);
  await execa('sudo', ['chmod', mode, destPath]);
}
```

The `mv` command is atomic on the same filesystem — the file appears at its final path in a single operation, so Authelia never reads a partially written file.

### Source files

| File                                           | Purpose                            |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `packages/create-portlama/src/tasks/harden.js` | Swap, UFW, fail2ban, SSH hardening |
| `packages/create-portlama/src/tasks/mtls.js`   | PKI generation, file permissions   |
| `packages/create-portlama/src/tasks/nginx.js`  | mTLS snippet, self-signed cert     |
| `packages/panel-server/src/lib/authelia.js`    | bcrypt hashing, atomic writes      |
| `packages/panel-server/src/lib/mtls.js`        | Certificate rotation with rollback |
| `packages/panel-server/src/lib/nginx.js`       | Vhost write-with-rollback pattern  |
| `packages/panel-server/src/middleware/mtls.js` | Request-level mTLS check           |

| **Total**         | **~245MB** | **48%**             |
| **Available**     | **~265MB** | **52%**             |
